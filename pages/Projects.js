                    We appoint ARQON because of their aesthetic taste. But we
                    were surprised because they delivered more than what we
                    expected. It was such a smooth process that building our
                    dream home was so chill. I like the transparency and the
                    commitment to the project. They were easy to talk to and we
                    had almost zero problems, making it such an easy ride for my
                    growing family. The best part about them is their commitment
                    even after the turn-over of the house. That’s what made us
                    believe we made the right decision with ARQON.

                    It was the best decision to hire Arqon to design and build
                    our dream vacation home. We met them in 2019 to kick off the
                    project and amidst the Taal eruption and long pandemic, they
                    managed to pull off a masterpiece that is beyond what we
                    ever imagined! They were always responsive to every single
                    question and request we have and worked on the budget we
                    set. And even after one year of turnover, they still provide
                    support whenever we need it! My husband and I are very
                    grateful to the entire team for making our dream come to
                    life.

                    Considering constructing my family’s house was always a
                    stressful thought for me. As the time neared that I needed
                    to pursue building our house, thoughts of what people shared
                    to me, and me witnessing their experiences started to flood
                    my mind. Those shared experiences to me were not pleasant
                    ones. From tales of “be ready to put your marriage to the
                    test” to “be ready to financially go over budget” are just
                    examples of what were confronting me whenever I sought
                    advice from friends who have gone the path of constructing
                    their dream homes. When our turn finally came, I was blessed
                    to have met the team of Arqon. From the onset: discussing
                    the design to discussing the contract, up until finally
                    building, I would summarize the overall experience as
                    smooth, highly professional and most importantly true to
                    commitments. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to
                    complete our dream house (covid times) in a little less than
                    a year, with the minimal of minimal (I must stress this) of
                    headaches. To summarize, dealing with Arqon was a breeze.
                    Simply put. Thank you Arqon for making this milestone in my
                    family’s life a positively memorable one.

                    We absolutely love our new home and have received many
                    compliments on it! It was built with the highest quality and
                    turned out even more beautiful than we ever imagined. Seeing
                    the house come to life has been an exciting time for us, and
                    we were very pleased with the prompt attention to detail
                    shown by the team. From start to finish, this has been an
                    enjoyable project thanks to ARQON Design+Build. We love our
                    new dream home!

                    ARQON helped me build my dream house from the planning stage
                    to full completion. When I bought a village lot of 235 sqm,
                    I knew I was in for a major challenge because I had big
                    plans that had to fit in a tiny space. In the tiny 235 sqm,
                    I wanted at least 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, a decent kitchen, a
                    generous living room space, pocket gardens, and as if to
                    make the project even more challenging, I wanted a pool.
                    After two preliminary meetings with Arqon, I was presented
                    with a brilliant plan that incorporates more than what I
                    initially thought. The resulting plan had 4 bedrooms, 3
                    baths, and all the rest of my specifications, in a coherent
                    layout that I immediately appreciated. It was a very easy
                    sell for me, as my sense of aesthetics and appreciation for
                    logic in architectural design was very much aligned with
                    Arqon’s. In executing the construction plan, three separate
                    contractors were hired. There was a contractor for the
                    building’s foundation and construction of a major retaining
                    wall at the basement level. There was a swimming pool
                    contract. Finally, Arqon was the main builder for the actual
                    structure. I give all the contractors, with Arqon as lead,
                    top commendation for the superb result of their work. Today,
                    my house is bordered by tall bamboos that work well to
                    highlight the design aesthetics of the structure, which land
                    squarely in the oxymoron: prominently subdued. I can
                    confidently say that it stands proud as the most beautiful
                    and well thought out in the two streets it is sitting on. As
                    a structure that is testament to the elegance of a
                    self-effacing design, it is a landmark.

                    When we thought of having our office renovated, I didn’t
                    have a concrete plan of how I wanted it to look like. I knew
                    what we wanted in terms of workflow and layout but the
                    aesthetics, not so much. When April presented their concept,
                    it was perfect! Everything was well thought off and the plan
                    was laid off really well. I was so excited to see our new
                    office, our new “home”. Even if the construction was
                    affected by the lockdowns, they somehow managed to finish
                    the project swiftly. Everyone was also very easy to work
                    with. From the Architects to the whole team for making our
                    beautiful office, it makes us feel good going to work
                    everyday.

                    Working with them is one of the best decisions we made in
                    planning our place. Everything was designed based on our
                    input and comfort. The assurance and confidence that we felt
                    during the meeting is one of the factors that made every
                    planning easy. From investing their time during the
                    meetings, considering the budget allocated for the project
                    and patience in taking minor revision, everything works
                    perfectly well. We are more than satisfied with the outcome.
                    Thank you ARQON Design!
