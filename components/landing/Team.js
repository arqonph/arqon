                    Manny’s journey to being a founding partner of ARQON began
                    way before his College of Architecture days at University of
                    Santo Tomas, where he graduated cum laude. His passion for
                    freehand drawing and rendering built the foundations of his
                    career and his stint as Asst. Designer at RR Payumo and
                    Partners and developed his natural eye for thoughtful
                    functional design. As Studio BIM Manager at Aidea
                    Philippines, he was part of the team that bagged the
                    prestigious international award for Sustainability,
                    Buildability and Constructability of the BIM Buzz in
                    Singapore demonstrating how Building Information Modeling
                    (BIM) can be used to its full potential.
