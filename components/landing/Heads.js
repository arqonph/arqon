                    April’s previous works as Senior Architect at GF and
                    Partners Architects for 8 years greatly contributed to the
                    firm’s prestigious recognitions by BCI Asia as one of the
                    top 10 architectural firms in the country. Her skill and
                    experience have helped her take on some of the most
                    celebrated projects of Ayala Land Premiere including upscale
                    residential condominiums, high-end commercial structures and
                    triple A offices.

                    Manny’s journey to being a founding partner of ARQON began
                    way before his College of Architecture days at University of
                    Santo Tomas, where he graduated cum laude. His passion for
                    freehand drawing and rendering built the foundations of his
                    career and his stint as Asst. Designer at RR Payumo and
                    Partners and developed his natural eye for thoughtful
                    functional design. As Studio BIM Manager at Aidea
                    Philippines, he was part of the team that bagged the
                    prestigious international award for Sustainability,
                    Buildability and Constructability of the BIM Buzz in
                    Singapore demonstrating how Building Information Modeling
                    (BIM) can be used to its full potential.

                      It was only a matter of time until Manny found himself
                      training his own pool of talented architects as BIM
                      Manager at GF and Partners Architects, one of the
                      Philippines’ most prominent architectural firms.
